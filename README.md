This project predicts 30-day hospital readmissions using structured EHR data and synthetic clinical data.

## Workflow:
1. Data loading & cleaning
2. Feature engineering (clinical features, comorbidity indices)
3. Model training (Random Forest & Gradient Boosting)
4. Evaluation (ROC-AUC, F1 score)
5. Interpretation & reporting
